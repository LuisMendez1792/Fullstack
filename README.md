This is my first FullStack program, to run the frontend you need to install VsCode and open the folder FrontEnd js there and then open the command line and execute this commands to run the frontend program
npm install axios
npm install bootstrap 
npm i react-bootstrap
npm i @fortawesome/react-fontawesome
npm i @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons
npm i react-player
npm i react-router-dom
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
npm install react-material-ui-carousel
once you have all this libraries, use this command to run the frontEnd "npm start"

and also make sure to run the backend before to Run the frontend.
Greating!! :)
